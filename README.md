# Gemini The Pro Coder

## This Streamlit app leverages the power of Google's Gemini LLM to generate code snippets based on user prompts. It provides a simple interface for users to input their coding requirements and receive code solutions directly within the app.

## Key Features:

1) Utilizes the Gemini-Pro language model for advanced code generation capabilities.

2) Presents a user-friendly Streamlit interface for easy interaction.

3) Displays generated code in a code block for easy copying and pasting.

## How to Use:

Install required libraries:

Obtain a Gemini API key: Sign up for the Gemini API and obtain API key. get api key here: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

Replace the placeholder API key: In the code, replace 'here enter you gemini api key' with actual API key

Run the app: Execute the Python script to start the Streamlit app.

Enter your code prompt: Type desired code requirements in the text input box.

Click "Get The Answer" button: The generated code will be displayed in a code block.

# Gemini LLM:

## Gemini is a powerful language model developed by Google AI. It excels at various tasks, including text generation, translation, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way. In this app, we harness Gemini-Pro's capabilities to generate code snippets based on user prompts.

## Leveraging Gemini LLM:

The code utilizes the google.generativeai library to interact with the Gemini LLM. The GenerativeModel class is instantiated with the gemini-pro model. The user's prompt is then fed into the model's generate_content method, which returns the generated code.
